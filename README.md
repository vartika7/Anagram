# Anagram
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag a ram, also the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode.
This code in Java helps us find if a string is anagram or not.
